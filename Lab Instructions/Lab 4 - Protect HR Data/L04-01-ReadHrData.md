In _Object Explorer_, right-click the "Contoso HR" database and select **New Query**.
Once the new query window connected to your database opens, paste the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM HR.Employees
```

On the toolbar, select **Execute** to run the query and you will see the employee data we just added listed in the Results pane.
